These are assignment-level problems, so no complex Data Structures or Algorithms here—just simple, practical coding!
🌟 What’s Inside

Lots of Problems: Different exercises to practice important C++ skills.
Pattern Problems: Cool tasks to help you understand loops and conditionals by making patterns.
Easy Solutions: Every problem has C++ code with comments to explain how it works.
Organized Folders: Problems are sorted into folders to make them easy to find.

🏁 How to Start
Follow these steps to begin:
1. Clone the Repository
Copy the repository to your computer with this command:
git clone https://github.com/gitkrypton18/CPP_PROBLEMS_LAB.git

2. Check Out a Folder
Go to a folder to see C++ files (.cpp) and sometimes problem descriptions.
cd CPP_PROBLEMS_LAB

3. Compile and Run
Use a C++ compiler (like G++) to run the programs:
g++ -o programName sourceFile.cpp
./programName

Tip: You need a C++ compiler, like G++ or Clang. If you’re on Windows, try MinGW or an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks.
